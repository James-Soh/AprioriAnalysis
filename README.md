# AprioriAnalysis

## Context of data analytics project
  As part of the DataQuest's [python data analyst](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst/) certification, there were many guided projects provided to help students reinforce their learning. 
  One particular guided project on analysing questions on [Data Science Stack Exchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/) had a prompt about contining with the project using Association analysis. It was not taught by DataQuest, but I had learnt it from my Business Analytics undergraduate using IBM SPSS Modeler.
  So I decided to combined the knowledge I gained from school as well as the knowlesge I gained from self-guided learning of data analytics into this project.

## Outline of analysis
  Handling missing via data cleaning
  Exploring the data with visualisations using plotly and seaborn
  One Hot encoding of a nested list in a pandas dataframe column
  Building an unsuprivsed model (Apriori model) to identify strong connection between tags

## Dataset source
  Has been uploaded to the repo.
